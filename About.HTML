   <h3> Here is what we have learned from Introduction to the Human Body:</h3>
    
    <p>The human body is a single structure but it is made up of billions of smaller structures of four major kinds: cells, tissues, organs, and systems.
    An organ is an organization of several different kinds of tissues so arranged that together they can perform a special function.
    A system is an organization of varying numbers and kinds of organs so arranged that together they can perform complex functions for the body.
    Ten major systems include the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and the reproductive system.
    Body functions are the physiological or psychological functions of body systems. Survival of the body depends on the body's maintaining or restoring homeostasis, a state of relative constancy, of its internal environment.
    Human life process includes organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movements, reproduction, growth, differentiation, respiration, digestion, and excretion. All these processes work together, in fine-tuned balance, for the well-being of the individual and to maintain life.
    Life depends on certain physical factors from the environment, which include water, oxygen, nutrients, heat, and pressure.
